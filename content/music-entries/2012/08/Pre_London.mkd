I'm currently sitting in SFO savoring my access to AC power as I don't think there is power on my flight. The flight leaves at 12:45pm and arrives at 7:30am. The plane I'm flying is a B777, it would have been cool if I could have flown in a B747 or even an A380. Anyways, I'm going to London and this song has "London" in it's name so it seems appropriate to share it. God save the Queen!
